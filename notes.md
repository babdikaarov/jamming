APIs
learners outside of the United States are unable to create a Spotify account. You are welcome to use any API you want that supports GET and POST requests. [Other APIs can be found on this page](https://rapidapi.com/blog/top-free-music-data-apis/) or [this page](https://rapidapi.com/collection/music-apis). If you are using an alternate API, you’ll need to adjust the following steps:

Obtain a Spotify Access Token
Implement Spotify Search Request
Save a User’s Playlist
